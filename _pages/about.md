My name is José Julián Álvarez Retamales and I am a second year PhD student at [NYU Linguistics](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics/graduate/graduate-program.html) working in Sociolinguistics working with [Dr. Renée Blake](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/renee-blake.html).

My work concerns identity in Latinx communities and its intersection with Blackness. I currently study this in Puerto Rico and the US. I strive to understand how diverse Blackness shows up linguistically in other places in the Caribbean.
