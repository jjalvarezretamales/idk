            This chapter aims to provide a practical template for groups and organizations who are new to conducting linguistic diversity outreach programs, which are essential educational tools for disseminating linguistic knowledge and scholarship to members of the general public. This work is grounded in the notion that linguists have an obligation to give back to the communities whose linguistic data are studied and analyzed in the academy. In this chapter, the authors illustrate two case studies of linguistic diversity outreach programs that have been implemented by the Linguistics Diversity Ambassadors (LDA), a graduate student-led organization at North Carolina State University.},
